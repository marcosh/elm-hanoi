# elm-hanoi
The Hanoi tower game implemented in Elm

## Objectives
- Represent with the model only valid states
- Provide a module reusable with different views

## Idea
- Treat the Hanoi Tower as a data structure. In the `Hanoi.elm` file just provide the data structure and how to interact with it.
